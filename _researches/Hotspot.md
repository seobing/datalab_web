### Hotspots-based patrol route optimization algorithm for smart policing

Smart policing based on the analysis of big data ensures the development and sustainability
of police policy. However, it is diﬃcult to find instances in which the results of data analysis
have been applied to actual policy in the field of crime prevention. The South Korean police
force recognizes the need for smart policing and is engaged in various research and field support
activities. Some examples that are especially relevant for crime investigation include analyzing
the connections between cases and predicting the location of the next crime in a series of crimes
and the location of suspects. However, it is diﬃcult to find examples of police policy that use big
data. Therefore, this study aims to suggest a model that uses big data to respond to emergency
calls eﬃciently. First, we extract hotspots that are predicted to be locations of criminal activity
based on an analysis of the association between community environment data and crime data.
Second, we create a route having the shortest travel time to the crime location by developing a
route optimization algorithm. Lastly, we assess the performance of the patrol routes in reflecting
real-time traﬃc information. If the data application model suggested in this study could be
adjusted and applied to the current police patrol system, the model could be used by each police
department eﬀectively.
