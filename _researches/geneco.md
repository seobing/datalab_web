### geneCo: A visualized comparative genomic method to analyze multiple genome structures method to analyze multiple genome structures

In comparative and evolutionary genomics, a detailed comparison of common features between organisms is essential to evaluate genetic distance. However, identifying differences in matched and mismatched genes among multiple genomes is difficult using current comparative genomic approaches due to complicated methodologies or the generation of meager information from obtained results. This study describes a visualized software tool, geneCo (gene Comparison), for comparing genome structure and gene arrangements between various organisms. User data are aligned, gene information is recognized, and genome structures are compared based on user-defined GenBank files. Information regarding inversion, gain, loss, duplication, and gene rearrangement among multiple organisms being compared is provided by geneCo, which uses a web-based interface that users can easily access without any need to consider the computational environment.
